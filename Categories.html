               <h2>Imposter Syndrome</h2>
                <p>Imposter syndrome is a psychological phenomenon in which a person is unable to internalize his achievements.  Despite external evidence of their worth, people susceptible to the syndrome continue to believe that they are deceivers and do not deserve the success they have achieved.  They usually attribute their success to luck, being in the right place and time, or misleading others into thinking they are smarter and more competent than they actually are.
                   <h4>Story</h4>
                 The term “imposter syndrome” first appeared in 1978 in an article by Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes, according to whose observations many successful women tended to believe that they were not smart, and  that others overestimate them.  Imposter syndrome is not considered a mental disorder and is not listed in the DSM-IV, but has been a topic of research by many psychologists.  It has been found that while some people are more susceptible to impostor syndrome, it is also not a personality trait, although long considered an innate quality, it has recently been studied as a reaction to certain situations.
                 <br><br>
                 <h4>Clinical picture</h4>
                <p>Feelings associated with impostor syndrome can be divided into three categories:</p>
                 <ul>
                  <li> Feeling like a pretender, when a person believes that he does not deserve the success or professional position achieved, believing that others mistakenly think otherwise.  As a rule, such thoughts go hand in hand with fears of being exposed, for example, that colleagues will understand how incompetent a person susceptible to the syndrome is in their professional field.  Fear of exposure greatly increases the fear of failure, as well as the fear of success, since success is assumed to be a big responsibility.</li>
                  <li>Explaining your successes by luck or other external reasons, but not by your work or abilities.  At the same time, the person is afraid that next time he will not be lucky.</li>
                 <li>Devaluation of one's successes when a person believes that the work done was too easy and did not deserve much attention.
                  According to some researchers, two family models often lead to impostor syndrome.  In the first case, parents evaluate their children differently, labeling them.  For example, they may consider one child smarter than another and not change their views about children, no matter what they do later.  Ultimately, this can lead to the child who was considered less smart not feeling smart, even if he gets better grades or achieves more success than the “smart” child.  In the second case, parents idealize their child.  Later, when the child grows up and faces difficulties, he begins to doubt the correctness of his parents, and also hides the fact that it is difficult for him, because he does not want to destroy his parents’ idealized idea of ​​himself.  As a result, this leads to the fact that a person considers himself mediocre.  Imposter syndrome is not an absolute diagnosis; some people may experience it in some situations and not in others.</li>
                  </ul>
                 <h4>Prevalence</h4>

                 <p>According to a psychological study conducted in the 1980s, two out of five successful people consider themselves liars, and other studies have found that 70% of people feel like imposters from time to time.  People who have reportedly experienced impostor syndrome include screenwriter Chuck Lorre, author Neil Gaiman, comedian Tommy Cooper, entrepreneur Sheryl Sandberg, US Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and actress Emma Watson.
                  Even Albert Einstein suffered from impostor syndrome towards the end of his life.  A month before his death, he confided to a friend: “The emphasis on respect that surrounds my life’s work makes me feel out of place.  I can’t help but feel like a fraud.”</p>
                 
                  <h4>Demographic</h4>
                 <p>Imposter syndrome was originally thought to be more common among women, but recent research has shown that it affects both successful men and successful women.  Other demographic groups affected by the syndrome include African Americans, gifted children and LGBT people.  When exposed to positive discrimination, people belonging to visible minorities are more likely to doubt their abilities and feel as if they were not hired because of their skills.  Impostor syndrome often affects postgraduate students and scientists starting their careers as teachers.</p>
