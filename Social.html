   <h3>Crowd psychology, danger features and mechanisms of action.</h3>
    <p>A crowd in psychology is a temporary unstructured gathering of people who often do not have a specific goal, but have a similar emotional state and a common object of attention.  One of the distinctive features of a crowd is that any individual, no matter how educated and intelligent, can dissolve in it.  The crowd becomes a single whole; individuals and their needs are not noticed.  Such large crowds of people can be quite dangerous - for example, if these are some kind of protests.  In such events, the protesters themselves often suffer.  Sometimes in a large crowd of people there is a crush, where you can get quite serious injury.  People don't stop to help the victim, they simply don't notice him.  As a result, a simple bruise can turn into a fracture, etc.
      In a large crowd of people there is no pressure or coercion; each person is simply charged with the general mood and follows the behavior of others.  Almost everyone saw the crowd or was part of it.
     
      <h5>Crowd structure:</h5>
     <p>If you look at a mass of people from a height, for example, from a helicopter or quadcopter, you will notice a division into three components.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Core. This is the space where there are the largest number of people per square meter.  Usually there is one core, it can be a stage, a podium, etc.  But it happens that there are several nuclei in the crowd - for example, a queue at a customs point, ticket office, metro.</li>
     
      <li>Middle lane. Here the number of people is smaller, the density is also smaller, but there are still quite a lot of participants in the event.  The middle is less dangerous than the core itself.  Here people usually strive to join the core, but are still outside it.</li>
      <li>Outskirts. There are usually even fewer people in this place than in the middle.  Some try to get from this place to the middle and core, while others want to get out.  This is a fairly safe space where people are almost not subject to the general mood of the crowd, but feel more free;  There is an individual perception rather than a collective one.</li>
    </ol>
       <p>This is a conditional division if the gathering of people is outdoors.  If it is indoors, for example, in a nightclub, then there will be only the core, without other components.  The outskirts are considered a safe place because there is no big crowd, but there are other dangers.  People after the core of the crowd are very annoyed.  Individual perception appears in the periphery, but personal emotions, often negative, also intensify.  Therefore, when you get from the core to the outskirts, you can stumble upon a very irritated group of people, because of which troubles of various kinds will arise.  The core is dangerous because it can move quite quickly and uncontrollably, and you can become a hostage to circumstances.  Here you were still standing calmly, and now you are being carried by a stream in an unknown direction.  In this case, you may be knocked off your feet or pinned against a wall.  If it turns out that participation could not be avoided, then it is better to be in the middle part.  There is more space and there is an opportunity to avoid injury.</p>
    <h5>Crowd Creation Mechanism:</h5>
 <ul>
 <li>nucleation.  A crowd forms spontaneously, but often there are instigators who pursue specific goals.  They push, call people together, provoke, etc.  Well-suggested individuals can easily follow the lead of such instigators and join the ranks of a crowd of people.  Sometimes this happens out of simple curiosity.  People join in more and more, becoming infected with the general mood and forming one continuous organism;</li>
 <li>whirling.  Tension builds within the crowd.  People, being in a general mood, are ready to instantly react to any stimulus without hesitation.  This can be a big problem for the society in which the crowd is located, but it is also a big plus for the instigators.  Any external stimulus can be perceived aggressively;</li>
 <li>emergence of a new object of attention.  Processes within the crowd - for example, conversations, gossip - greatly increase tension and heighten feelings.  Sometimes the reason for people gathering changes dramatically.  For example, at rallies.  People gathered to hold a peaceful protest, but suddenly the calm people could turn into an aggressive wave.  Any external irritant can prompt people to act aggressively, and the reaction of the crowd can be too violent;</li>
 <li>activation of individuals.  The tension in the crowd is growing and requires some kind of outlet.  The instigators set a certain mood and inspire that the actions of the masses are correct.  Sometimes these are completely illogical and dangerous actions that can lead to unfavorable consequences for people.  The instigators or one leader thus strive to achieve their goal.  The crowd may have one leader if it is, for example, a political demonstration.  One person is the speaker who sets the general mood.</li>
</ul> 

<h5>Psychological properties and dangers of crowds:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Suggestibility. People are very easily influenced by others.  They all have approximately the same mood and are ready to act at the same time, this can be dangerous for society.</li>
  <li>Unawareness. The crowd is not guided by logic, only by emotions.  This can be detrimental to themselves and to others.  The unconscious part of every person prevails over consciousness, common sense leaves people, and the herd instinct kicks in.</li>
  <li>Categorical. People in the crowd do not doubt the correctness of their beliefs and actions.  They are absolutely sure of what they have been told.  They cannot look at the situation from different sides, they are like fanatics who blindly follow some idea.</li>
  <li>Stimulate the imagination. The crowd is charged not only with the general mood, but also forms the same images.  Due to mass perception, reality is greatly distorted.  Especially if the crowd is influenced by some authoritative leader.</li>
  <li>Increased sensitivity. The feelings of each person are heated to the limit, which means that the general mood is the same.  Rationality, personal interests and the basic instinct of self-preservation fade into the background.  At the first stage, the collective unconscious and common emotions appear.  A person feels like he is part of something great and is able to perform any action for the sake of this feeling.</li>
  <li>Lack of responsibility. People feel a special unity and do not think about personal responsibility for their actions.  It seems to them that everything will go unpunished.  It is this feeling that makes the crowd quite cruel.</li>
  <li>Extremism. In most cases the crowd is destructive.  Each participant shows the worst sides of their personality, which are hidden in ordinary life.  Rage and cruelty often accompany crowds.  These destructive emotions can manifest themselves completely out of proportion to the situation, even to a minor stimulus.</li>
</ol>
