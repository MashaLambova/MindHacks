   <h3>Multitasking without harm</h3>
<p>The term multitasking first appeared in the 1960s: it referred to computer systems that performed several algorithmic processes simultaneously.  Then the definition moved into psychology and began to be applied to people.
Multitasking was originally a panacea for productivity.  It was believed that doing several things in one unit of time helps to improve academic performance and pumps up the brain.  However, Clifford Nass, a professor at Stanford University, believes it is necessary to concentrate on only one task.  Summing up the results of his research, he notes that the more things a person tries to do at once, the less good the results will be at the end: “Those who are used to multitasking sacrifice the quality of the main task being performed.  They often do a lot of unnecessary things.”  According to the professor, those “suffering” from multitasking are not able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>focus on one thing;</li>
 <li>analyze information;</li>
 <li>do the job efficiently;</li>
 </ul>
        <p>American professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation Jordan Grafman from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke fully confirms the words of Nass: “Improving the ability to multitask interferes with our ability to think deeply and creatively... The more tasks you assign to yourself, the less purposeful you become, the more  less able to reason soundly and solve problems.”
        <p>Multitasking has become a bad habit.  Some time ago it was believed that cognitive impairments from simultaneous tasks went away without a trace.  However, a team of researchers from the University of Sussex found that multitasking people have lower brain density in the area that is responsible for empathy, cognitive and emotional control.  Now the authors of books on time management say one thing: make a plan and solve tasks in order - nothing else.</p>
        Unfortunately, not everyone nowadays has the opportunity to complete tasks one after another.  Often you have to combine everything in order to achieve greater productivity (often imaginary).  This approach has a negative impact not only on the quality of the work done, but also on health.</p>
        <p>Professor of the Finnish Aalto University, neuroscientist Airo Jaaskeläinen, in the course of a scientific study, discovered that a person who practices performing several tasks simultaneously, devoting 5-10 minutes to each, reduces his productivity by 30% or more.  There is a high probability of making a stupid mistake that could not have occurred with proper concentration.  The physical and psychological state also suffers: cognitive and emotional control, which was mentioned above, is disrupted, you can easily become overtired and lay down with a fever for several days.  However, under certain conditions, multitasking can still be beneficial.</p>
        <p>The second condition for multitasking without harm: switch from the main task to a secondary one.  In this situation, there is a background process in the head.  In her book Think Like a Mathematician, Barbara Oakley, a professor of engineering at the University of Auckland, notes that the brain has two different processing modes: focused and diffuse.  They are modal.  Simply put, distracted thinking is an autopilot mode that allows you to explore new possibilities, find paths, and embrace the bigger picture.  Thanks to this mode, it is possible to see the context.  The author of the book also advises not to “rape” your gray matter and give yourself a break from being in a focused state.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to be in two phases at the same time.</p>
        <p>At first glance, focused mode is very effective.  However, it limits thinking.  It should be used only in cases where little time is required for a task or there is a pressing deadline.  In the scattered mode, the process of forming new neural connections takes place, and in the focused mode they are strengthened by frequent repetition of any action.  Constantly switching between these modes is very important for work or training.  Staying in one mode for a long time is unproductive.  Don’t forget to switch your attention from the main task to a less important one: the transition to a diffuse state allows you to generate new ideas.</p>
        <p> If you need to do a large amount of mental work, but your daily plan includes cleaning the house, then you can safely connect multitasking.  Dedicate 30-40 minutes to the main activity and 10 minutes to the secondary activity.  This is how the brain will have the opportunity to take a break from strong concentration on the main task and come up with another interesting approach to the work that was done previously.</p>
